Tzu-Ting obtained her B.Sc. in Organic Chemistry from National Taiwan Normal University and received her Ph.D. under the supervision of Dr. Kak-Shan Shia with Dr. Chun-Cheng Lin at National Tsing Hua University as a co-advisor in 2016. Her Ph.D. research focused on the development of an efficient radical tandem cyclization and applied the strategy to synthesize three natural products: retrojusticidin B, justicidin E and helioxanth. In 2017, she joined Dr. Lowaryâ€™s group as a postdoctoral fellow. Her research focused on the synthesis of acceptor substrates for an enzyme GlfT2, which is involved in arabinogalactan biosynthesis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
