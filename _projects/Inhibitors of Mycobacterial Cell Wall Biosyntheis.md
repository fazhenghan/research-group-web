A major research effort in the group has been the identification of inhibitors of glycosyltransferases responsible for cell wall polysaccharide biosynthesis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the organism that causes tuberculosis. As part of these investigations, we have recently expressed a galactosyltransferase (glfT), that is critical for mycobacterial viability. Thus, compounds that inhibit this enzyme are potential anti-TB drugs. We are now mapping the substrate specificity of glfT, and have developed a high throughput assay for the screening of potential inhibitors. In parallel with these investigations, inhibitors are being synthesized and we will probe the three dimensional structure of the protein using X-ray crystallography and NMR methods. We are also extending our work to a mannosyltransferase (ManT) involved in the biosynthesis of the mycobacterial cell wall.
