## A Header

We have a long-standing interest in the synthesis of oligosaccharides containing 
monosaccharides in the five-membered ring (furanose) form. These species are constituents of a 
number of key glycoconjugates from bacteria, fungi, and parasites. In addition to the total 
synthesis of targets, we also develop new methodologies as needed, often with the help of 
mechanistic investigations. Among the targets currently of interest are large fragments of 
mycobacterial arabinogalactan (1, the synthesis of which we recently completed), and 
structurally-interesting oligosaccharides found in bacteria (e.g., 2 and 3).
