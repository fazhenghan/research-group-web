Vitor received his Bachelor of Pharmacy in 2014 at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) in Brazil and, as part of an exchange program (Science Without Borders) during his undergraduate degree, he studied for a year in the University of Alberta, where he did a 3-month internship in Dr. Lowary’s group.  Vitor then received his M.Sc. in Pharmaceutical Sciences in 2016 with Dr. Ricardo José Alves from UFMG on the synthesis of potential Trypanosoma brucei phosphofructokinase inhibitors derived from 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol. In the same year, he joined Dr. Lowary’s group as a PhD student and is currently working on the synthesis of bradyrhizose oligosaccharides.
