Mikel received his B.Sc. in Biochemistry in 2015 from De La Salle University in Manila, Philippines. There he worked under Dr. Gladys Completo on the synthesis of probes for specificity of UDP-galactofuranosyltransferase 2 (GlfT2) involved in the galactan biosynthesis. He then worked as a research assistant in the lab of Dr. Completo in the University of the Philippines-Los Baños. He joined the Dr. Lowary’s group in 2017 as a Ph.D. and his research work focuses on the synthesis of highly immunogenic oligosaccharide fragment from glycoprotein gp72 from Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite causing Chagas disease.
