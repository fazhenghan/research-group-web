Todd L. Lowary received his B.A. in Chemistry from the University of Montana in 1988 and obtained his Ph.D. in Organic Chemistry under the supervision of Professor Ole Hindsgaul at the University of Alberta in 1993.  He carried out postdoctoral research with Professor David R. Bundle at the University of Alberta (1993-1995), and then with Dr. Morten P. Meldal at the Carlsberg Laboratory in Copenhagen, Denmark (1995-1996).   In 1996, he took a position in The Department of Chemistry at The Ohio State University as an Assistant Professor and in 2002 was promoted to Associate Professor with tenure. In 2003, he returned to the University of Alberta where he is a currently the Raymond U. Lemieux Professor of Carbohydrate Chemistry and a Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in the Department of Chemistry. He is also a member of the <a href="http://www.glycomicscentre.ca/" target="_blank">Alberta Glycomics Centre</a>, a group of ten principal investigators at the University of Alberta and the University of Calgary who work in the areas of carbohydrate chemistry and glycobiology, and is the Scientific Director of the <a href="http://canadianglycomics.ca/" target="_blank">Canadian Glycomics Network (GlyoNet)</a>. Funded by the <a href="http://www.nce-rce.gc.ca/Index_eng.asp" target="_blank">NCE program</a>, GlycoNet is a pan-Canadian research network with the mission of delivering glycomics-based solutions to unmet medical needs and in so doing improve the quality of life of Canadians.
